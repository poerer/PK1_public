/**
 * (*2*)
 * This class is an example of a bike.
 * We have to think about characteristics of the bike, as well
 * as certain properties and abilities.
 * 
 * You will notice that the Bicycle class does not contain a main method. 
 * That's because it's not a complete application; it's just the blueprint for 
 * bicycles that might be used in an application. The responsibility of creating 
 * and using new Bicycle objects belongs to some other class in your application.
 * In our example, it is the class ObjectOrientation.java.
 * 
 * Another difference to previous sessions is the method declaration.
 * You will notice that a keyword in the head of a method declaration is missing 
 * ('static'). This keyword is responsible for telling the compiler to interpret
 * the method/variable as a class or object variable/method. The difference
 * between the two will be explained in the next lecture.

	/*
	 * The Bicycle class uses the following lines of code to define its fields (properties):
	 * 	
	 *  public int cadence;
	 * 	public int gear;
	 * 	public int speed;
	 * 
	 * Field declarations are composed of three components, in order:
	 * 1. Zero or more modifiers, such as public or private.
	 * 2. The field's type.
	 * 3. The field's name.
	 * The fields of Bicycle are named cadence, gear, and speed and are all of data type 
	 * integer (int). The public keyword identifies these fields as public members, 
	 * accessible by any object that can access the class.
	 * The first (left-most) modifier used lets you control what other classes have access 
	 * to a member field. For the moment, consider only public and private. Other access 
	 * modifiers will be discussed later in your studies.
	 * public modifier = the field is accessible from all classes.
	 * private modifier = the field is accessible only within its own class.
	 * In the spirit of encapsulation, it is common to make fields private. This means 
	 * that they can only be directly accessed from the Bicycle class. We still need 
	 * access to these values, however. This can be done indirectly by adding public 
	 * methods that obtain the field values for us (setter and getter methods).
