/**
 * (*1*)
 * Introduction to Inheritance and the substitution principle.
 * The most important keywords for this session are 'extends' and 'super'.
 * In the Java language, classes can be derived from other classes, thereby 
 * inheriting fields and methods from those classes.
 * A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a 
 * derived class, extended class, or child class). The class from which the 
 * subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent 
 * class).
 * Excepting Object, which has no superclass, every class has one and only one 
 * direct superclass (single inheritance). In the absence of any other explicit 
 * superclass, every class is implicitly a subclass of Object.
 * Classes can be derived from classes that are derived from classes that are 
 * derived from classes, and so on, and ultimately derived from the topmost class, 
 * Object. Such a class is said to be descended from all the classes in the 
 * inheritance chain stretching back to Object.
 * 
 * The idea of inheritance is simple but powerful: When you want to create a new 
 * class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that you 
 * want, you can derive your new class from the existing class. In doing this, 
 * you can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class without having to 
 * write (and debug!) them yourself.
 * A subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from 
 * its superclass. Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by 
 * subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.
 * The Object class, defined in the java.lang package, defines and implements behavior 
 * common to all classesâ€”including the ones that you write. In the Java platform, 
 * many classes derive directly from Object, other classes derive from some of those 
 * classes, and so on, forming a hierarchy of classes. That is why, if you write your 
 * own class and instantiate an object you notice some methods you have not
 * written e.g., notify(). At the top of the hierarchy, Object is the most general 
 * of all classes. Classes near the bottom of the hierarchy provide more specialized 
 * behavior. 
 * 
 * Again, we make use of the Bicycle example from the former chapters to help you 
 * understand this important topic. Imagine that we want to write a new class
 * MountainBike. As you might expect, mountain bikes have the same properties
 * and capabilities as bikes but are a little more specific e.g., it is a special
 * kind of bike suitable for running up and down hills. Another example could be 
 * a racing bike, which is especially suited for driving really fast on roads.
 * The main properties and capabilities are identical to bikes. Mountain bikes 
 * can also speed up or break. We can get the number of gears etc. BUT we do not
 * want to write all of this again. We just say mountain bikes are basically bikes
 * with some additional features/properties/behavior.
 * ->switch to MountainBike.java (*2*)

		 * The speed of the bike is automatically printed to the console, because

		 * that we have accessed a property declared in Bicycle using our more
		 * specific MountainBike. We do not have to write all the properties
		 * and methods again, we just use them -> REALLY COOL!

		/*
		 * Substitution principle:
		 * We have seen that an object is of the data type of the class from 
		 * which it was instantiated. For example, if we write:
		 * 				MountainBike myBike = new MountainBike();
		 * then myBike is of type MountainBike.
		 * MountainBike is descended from Bicycle and Object. Therefore, a 
		 * MountainBike is a Bicycle and is also an Object, and it can be used 
		 * wherever Bicycle or Object objects are called for.
		 * 
		 * The reverse is not necessarily true: a Bicycle may be a MountainBike, 
		 * but it isn't necessarily. Similarly, an Object may be a Bicycle or a 
		 * MountainBike, but it isn't necessarily.
		 * Casting shows the use of an object of one type in place of another type, 
		 * among the objects permitted by inheritance and implementations. For 
		 * example, if we write:
		 * 				Object obj = new MountainBike();
		 * then obj is both an Object and a MountainBike (until such time as obj 
		 * is assigned another object that is not a MountainBike). This is called 
		 * implicit casting.
		 * If, on the other hand, we write:
		 * 				MountainBike myBike = obj;
		 * we would get a compile-time error because obj is not known to the 
		 * compiler to be a MountainBike. However, we can tell the compiler that 
		 * we promise to assign a MountainBike to obj by explicit casting:
		 * 				MountainBike myBike = (MountainBike)obj;
		 * This cast inserts a runtime check that obj is assigned a MountainBike 
		 * so that the compiler can safely assume that obj is a MountainBike. If 
		 * obj is not a MountainBike at runtime, an exception will be thrown.
		 * 
		 * Important:
		 * You can make a logical test as to the type of a particular object 
		 * using the instanceof operator. This can save you from a runtime error 
		 * owing to an improper cast. For example:
		 * 				if (obj instanceof MountainBike) 
		 * 				{
		 * 					MountainBike myBike = (MountainBike)obj;
		 * 				}
		 * Here the instanceof operator verifies that obj refers to a MountainBike 
		 * so that we can make the cast with knowledge that there will be no 
		 * runtime exception thrown.
