 * We will extend and adept the Bicycle class using class variables (properties)
 * and the 'this' reference.  
 * 
 * When a number of objects are created from the same class blueprint, they each 
 * have their own distinct copies of instance variables. In the case of the 
 * Bicycle class, the instance variables are cadence, gear, and speed. Each Bicycle 
 * object has its own values for these variables, stored in different memory 
 * locations. Sometimes, you want to have variables that are common to all objects. 
 * This is accomplished with the static modifier. Fields that have the static 
 * modifier in their declaration are called static fields or class variables. 
 * They are associated with the class, rather than with any object. Every instance 
 * of the class shares a class variable, which is in one fixed location in memory. 
 * Any object can change the value of a class variable, but class variables can 
 * also be manipulated without creating an instance of the class.
 * For example, suppose you want to create a number of Bicycle objects and assign 
 * each a serial number, beginning with 1 for the first object. This ID number is 
 * unique to each object and is therefore an instance variable. At the same time, 
 * you need a field to keep track of how many Bicycle objects have been created so 
 * that you know what ID to assign to the next one. Such a field is not related to 
 * any individual object, but to the class as a whole. For this you need a class 
 * variable, getCount, as follows:
